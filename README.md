# **React use-favicon**

A React hook to update the favicon of your app. This can be useful to quickly add a favicon to a side project, or to dynamically change the icon based on certain app states.

## **Features**

| TODO: These features should all have animated screenshots to make it visual

- Favicon can be either a regular image icon, an emoji, or a color palette
- Favicon can change based on tab focus or dark mode
- A notification badge can be triggered on the icon

## **Getting started**

```jsx
npm install use-favicon
```

```jsx
import useFavicon from "use-favicon";

// in your functional React component
useFavicon();

// ðŸ‘† with default options, this will set your favicon to a random emoji
```

## Example

```jsx
import useFavicon from "use-favicon";

export default function App() {
  useFavicon({
    // options here
  });

  return <div>Example app!</div>;
}
```

## **API**

`useFavicon` takes an options object as follows:

```jsx
// TODO
```

It will return the following functions:

```jsx
// TODO
```

## Requirements
